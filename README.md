# Face Preprocessing and Age Detection

This project uses **dlib** for face detection and **OpenCV** along with a pre-trained model for age detection.
It processes input images, detects faces, predicts ages, and annotates the image with age information.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- OpenCV
- dlib
- DeepFace

## Installation

1. **Install the dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the code**:

```
python face_preprocessing.py
```
